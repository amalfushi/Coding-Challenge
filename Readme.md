Hello,

These are my submissions to the challenges presented by Zulily after the Comparably Tech Job Fair found here (https://zulily-coding-challenge.amp.store.aws.z8s.io/).

I used Javascript and Node.js for both.  Node can be found here if needed (https://nodejs.org/en/).
Both folders include the samples provided on the website and the challenges can be run by browsing to the respective folders in terminal/cmd and either:
1. 'node Challenge1.js'
2. 'npm start' if Node Package Manager is also installed.

Thanks for the challenges, they were interesting!
