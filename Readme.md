Hello,

These are my submissions to the challenges that were given out during Comparably Tech Job Fair.

I used Javascript and Node.js for both.  Node can be found here if needed (https://nodejs.org/en/).
Both folders include the samples provided on the website and the challenges can be run by browsing to the respective folders in terminal/cmd and either:
1. 'node Challenge1.js'
2. 'npm start' if Node Package Manager is also installed.

Thanks for the challenges, they were interesting!
